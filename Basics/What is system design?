1) Vertical Scaling
Scaling up refers to the process of increasing the capacity of a single server to handle more load.
Eg, Upgrading hardware, increasing RAM, increasing CPU cores

Limitations:- Single point of failure, Downtime, cost

2) PreProcessing using cron jobs:-
Using your server capabilities to preprocess some things before major piece of work.

3) Backup Servers
If one server goes down, having a backup with another server will never let business go down

4) Horizontal scaling
Scaling up the number of servers

5) Microservices
Breaking down a complex application into smaller, loosely-coupled services that can be developed,
deployed, and scaled independently.
a) Domain driven design -> Identify each service responsibility and boundaries
b) decoupling -> Use APIs or message queues for inter-service communication.

6)Distributed systems
For availability, same system across different regions

7)Load balancing
Central place which routes request to different systems in different locations
Basis can be anything-> For eg FC wise, Time wise, location wise

8)Logging and metrics
As we have divided responsibilities, we want to find point of failures or bottlenecks within the system
